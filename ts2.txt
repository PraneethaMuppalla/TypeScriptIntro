Node.js has its own set of modules and APIs that are not present in the browser environment.
 These include modules like fs (File System), http (HTTP server), path, util, and many others.
  To write TypeScript code that interacts with these Node.js modules,
   you need type definitions that describe the types and structures of these modules.

   
When working with TypeScript and Express, installing @types/express is essential. 
This package provides TypeScript type definitions (typings) for the Express.js framework. 
These type definitions allow TypeScript to understand and check the types of Express-specific features, enhancing development by providing static typing, code intelligence, and type checking.
